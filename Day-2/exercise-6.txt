### making use of puppet forge

## navigate to puppet forge page on web browser... https://forge.puppet.com/

## search for modules and look for the module that you want to download and install on Puppet server.

$ puppet module install <module-name> --version <version number>

## once install inside the required directory move the module folder to modules under production or any other environment folder of your requirement or public modules folder.

##inside nodes.pp file update the class statement.

## Working with Hiera.

## Hiera configuration file is located in /etc/puppetlabs/code/environment/production/hiera.yaml  and also in /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml.  we can update the configuration as per our requirement.

## for testing purpose 

$ vi common.yaml
username: user1

##Now update the nodes.pp or a manifest file inside a module with a node name resource statement as below.

node <nodename> {
     notify { lookup(username): } 
   }

## now run the lookup command to check.

$ sudo puppet lookup username --explain  

## if we remove --explain option then we will get the data displayed on the screen.

## to test the implementation on puppet agent run, try running the puppet agent on the defined agent.

$ sudo puppet agent -t
