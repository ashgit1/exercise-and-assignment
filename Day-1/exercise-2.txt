#Bootstraping Puppet Agent to Puppet server

#In order to make sure the Puppet Agent is able to connect and send certificate signing request to Puppet Server, make below changes to the puppet.conf file on the Puppet Agent at,

$ sudo nano /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf

[main]
certname = node1     # FQDN or DNS name of the agent machine
server = puppet
runinterval = 1h

On the puppet server, a sample puppet.conf file can be as shown below,
[main]
certname = puppet
server = puppet
runinterval = 1h
strict_variables = true

#[server]
#dns_alt_names = puppet,<FQDN>
#reports = puppetdb
#storeconfigs_backend = puppetdb
#storeconfigs = true

# Now, on the Puppet Agent run below command

$ sudo puppet agent -t

# Now, on the puppet server check if the server has received the Agent sign request.

$ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca list

# sign the certificate signing request on the server
$ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca sign --certname <node-certificate-name> 

######### incase of any error wwhile signing a certificate on the server , try removeing the cert and recrete it #############

# incase if a certificate is to be removed from the list of certs from the server, we use command,
$ sudo puppetservr ca clean --certname <certificate-name>

# incase if a certificate is to be deleted from the server
$ sudo puppetserver ca delete --certname <certificate-name>

# now to remove a local cert from the agent
$ sudo puppet ssl --localca clean

# now create a new certificate by running,
$ sudo puppet agent -t
